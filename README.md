# comment package for atom

Atom package for inserting block- or single line comments via keyboard shortcut

## Usage
Select the text you want to comment, and hit ```shift-cmd-m```
If selection is empty, an empty comment block will be inserted

## Language support
...is based on file extensions and will be added incrementally.
First release supports block comments and single line comments for:
* .class
* .coffee
* .cs
* .html/.htm (bug in single line comments will be fixed in v0.2.4)
* .js
* .rb

## TODO
* Better error handling
* Test coverage (learn to write testable javascript...)
* Better language support
